# rapid-git

![rapid-git Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid-git/rapid-git/master/images/demo.gif)

rapid-git provides shortcuts for often-used git commands which aim to make your
daily git use more efficient by typing less.

rapid-git enables you to interact with files and branches using numbers (called
indexes). Indexes represent the files that `git status` or branches that `git
branch` prints on the screen. When interacting with files you may define ranges
using the [numbers and dots notation](#specifying-indexes).

The concept behind rapid-git was introduced by [Alexander
Gro√ü](https://github.com/agross) in his repository
[git_shizzle](https://github.com/agross/git_shizzle). In contrast to this
repository, which uses shell, he implemented his project using Ruby. If you are
interested, please have a look at his project too.

[Gregor Woiwode](https://github.com/GregOnNet) recorded a video about rapid-git:

## Prerequisites and installation

There are a few prerequisites worth mentioning:

* Your bash version needs to be at least v4.0.0. Use the command `bash
  --version` to check yours.
* If you use zsh, be aware that we tested the script with v5.0.2 and v5.1.1. Use
  `zsh --version` to check yours.
* If you use macOS, make sure, that you have `gnu-sed` installed. The easiest
  way is to use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install it: `brew install gnu-sed
  --with-default-names`. For more extensive instructions on how to install GNU
  command line tools on macOS, please refer to this [blog
  post](https://www.topbug.net/blog/2013/04/14/install-and-use-gnu-command-line-tools-in-mac-os-x/).

Let's install rapid-git:

1. Start with cloning this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rapid-git/rapid-git.git
   ```

1. Add *rapid-git.sh* to *.bashrc* or *.zshrc*:
   ```sh
   source path/to/rapid-git.sh
   ```

1. At this point rapid-git should already work, but you may also add
   `alias.rapid-git.sh` to get some default aliases.
   ```sh
   source path/to/alias.rapid-git.sh
   ```

**Note for Windows users:** There is a certain trick for Windows users, who wish
to create files such as `.bashrc` via the Windows Explorer. When typing the file
name, do it as follows without defining a file extension: `.bashrc.`

## Commands

### Specifying Indexes

Indexes always refer to the position of a file, directory or branch in the
output of `git status` and `git branch`. Indexes start at **1** not at **0**.
Ranges can be defined using numbers and dots notation. There are the following
notations available:

| notation           | description                                     |
| :----------------- |:----------------------------------------------- |
| `#`                | select a single list entry                      |
| `..`               | select all list entries                         |
| `..#` e.g. `..5`   | select the first entry up to the fifth one      |
| `#..` e.g. `3..`   | select the third entry up to the last one       |
| `#..#` e.g. `4..7` | select the fourth entry up to the seventh entry |

* [Index commands](#index-commands) support indexes or ranges.
* [Index commands](#index-commands) allow multiple arguments to be passed.
* [Branch commands](#branch-commands) only support a single index.

### Index Commands

These commands relate to the git index and the working copy.

* [rapid status](#rapid-status)
* [rapid track](#rapid-track)
* [rapid stage](#rapid-stage)
* [rapid unstage](#rapid-unstage)
* [rapid drop](#rapid-drop)
* [rapid remove](#rapid-remove)
* [rapid diff](#rapid-diff)
* **[Create your own commands](#custom-file-commands)**

### Branch Commands

These commands relate to git branches.

* [rapid branch [-d | -D | -a | -r]](#rapid-branch)
* [rapid checkout](#rapid-checkout)
* [rapid merge](#rapid-merge)
* [rapid rebase [-c | --continue | -a | --abort]](#rapid-rebase)

---

### rapid status

* Show **staged files** with index
* Show **unstaged files** with index
* Show **untracked files** with index
* Show **unmerged files** with index *(no other rapid command works with these
  indexes yet)*

### rapid track

* Track one or multiple files by [index or range](#specifying-indexes)
* Equivalent to `git add`, allows passing arbitrary options
* Indexes based on **untracked files** and folders of `rapid status`

### rapid stage

* Stage one or multiple files by [index or range](#specifying-indexes)
* Equivalent to `git add`, allows passing arbitrary options (e.g. `--patch`)
* Indexes are based on **unstaged files** of `rapid status`

### rapid unstage

* Unstage one or multiple files by [index or range](#specifying-indexes)
* Equivalent to `git reset HEAD`, allows passing arbitrary options (e.g.
  `--patch`)
* Indexes are based on **staged files** of `rapid status`

### rapid drop

* Drop unstaged changes of one or multiple files by [index or
  range](#specifying-indexes)
* Equivalent to `git checkout`, allows passing arbitrary options (e.g.
  `--patch`)
* Indexes are based on **unstaged files** of `rapid status`

### rapid remove

* Remove one or multiple files by [index or range](#specifying-indexes)
* Equivalent to `rm -rf`, allows passing arbitrary `rm` options
* Indexes are based on **untracked files** of `rapid status`
* When removing a directory, this command tries to remove sub-level files and
  directories, too

### rapid diff

* Show the diff of one or multiple files by [index or
  range](#specifying-indexes)
* Equivalent to `git diff`, allows passing arbitrary options options (e.g.
  `--word-diff`)
* Indexes are based on **unstaged files** of `rapid status` when using no
  additional option
* Indexes are based on **staged files** of `rapid status` when using `--cached`
  or `--staged` as the first option

### Custom file commands

You can create your own rapid commands to handle untracked files, unstaged files
and staged files. It's best to define these as aliases to save you some typing.

There are three sub-commands available to you:

* `rapid custom untracked` to handle **untracked files** by [index or
  range](#specifying-indexes)
* `rapid custom worktree` to handle **unstaged files** by [index or
  range](#specifying-indexes)
* `rapid custom index` to handle **staged files** by [index or
  range](#specifying-indexes)

All commands require 3 arguments of which 2 should be defined in your aliases.
The general form is:

```sh
rapid custom {untracked|worktree|index} <mark> <command> <index>...
```

`mark` and `command` should be defined by the alias, whereas `index`es will
later be added to the command when you execute the alias.

`mark` is responsible for displaying the symbol in front of files processed:

* `stage` displays `>`, `~` or `+` depending on file status
* `reset` displays `<`, `~` or `-` depending on file status
* `drop` displays `-` or `~` depending on file status
* `false` disables all output, even in case of errors

`command` can be any git command, e. g. `git add`, `git add --patch`, `git reset
HEAD`, `git update-index --assume-unchanged`, `git diff --staged` etc. You need
to make sure not to pass any arguments describing files to be processed. E.g.
`git add --all` is forbidden, albeit not checked for.

In fact, you can also use other programs like `cat`:

```sh
$ alias qcat='rapid custom worktree false cat'
$ qcat 1
# Displays contents of unstaged file at index 1.
```

Using this facility you can in fact [recreate all builtin
commands](https://github.com/agross/dotfiles/blob/master/git/rapid-git-aliases.zsh).

* Force-delete a branch by using the option `-D`
* Using the options `-r`, `-a`, `-d` and `-D` requires to pass a branch along by
  using its index
* Indexes are based on `git branch | rapid branch`

### rapid checkout

## Default aliases

| alias         | description         |
| ------------- |:--------------------|
| `rst`         | `rapid status`      |
| `rt`          | `rapid track`       |
| `ra`          | `rapid stage`       |

| `rre`         | `rapid rebase`      |

## Color configuration

### Disabling colors

rapid-git colorizes output by default unless output is being redirected or if it
is invoked as part of a pipeline. You can explicitly disable output coloring by
setting the variable `RAPID_GIT_COLORS` to a falsey value (`0`, `false`, `off`).
You do not need to export the value.

Example:

```sh
$ RAPID_GIT_COLORS=off
```

### Custom color values

Color values are either determined by corresponding git colors (e.g. unstaged
changes are colored [like `git status` would - search for
`color.status.<slot>`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)). You may override
some or all of the color values by defining `RAPID_GIT_COLORS` as an associative
array. The following array subscripts are evaluated by rapid-git:

| subscript              | description                                                    | git config               | default color     |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :---------------- |
| `reset`                | reset color back to defaults                                   |                          | (invisible)       |
| `branch`               | branch names                                                   | `color.branch.local`     | cyan              |
| `branch_index`         | branch indexes                                                 |                          | yellow            |
| `branch_current`       | current branch name                                            | `color.branch.current`   | bold cyan         |
| `branch_current_index` | current branch index                                           |                          | bold yellow       |
| `status_index`         | index of `rapid status`                                        |                          | bold yellow       |
| `status_staged`        | staged files                                                   | `color.status.added`     | bold red          |
| `status_unstaged`      | unstaged files                                                 | `color.status.changed`   | bold green        |
| `status_untracked`     | untracked files                                                | `color.status.untracked` | bold blue         |
| `status_unmerged`      | unmerged files                                                 | `color.status.changed`   | bold magenta      |
| `mark_stage`           | color of symbol printed in front of files about to be staged   |                          | yellow            |
| `mark_reset`           | color of symbol printed in front of files about to be unstaged |                          | yellow            |
| `mark_drop`            | color of symbol printed in front of files about to be removed  |                          | cyan              |
| `mark_error`           | color of symbol for errors (e.g. nonexistent index)            |                          | bold red          |

**Defining colors on Windows will most certainly speed up your rapid-git
invocations because we can omit creating a couple of git processes.**

Example:

```sh
declare -A RAPID_GIT_COLORS
RAPID_GIT_COLORS[status_index]='\e[0;34m' # blue
RAPID_GIT_COLORS[branch_index]='\e[1;31m' # bright red
# etc.

# zsh users may use builtin colors support.
autoload -U colors && colors
typeset -A RAPID_GIT_COLORS
RAPID_GIT_COLORS[status_index]=$fg[blue]
RAPID_GIT_COLORS[branch_index]=$fg_bold[red]
```

### Debugging colors

The `rapid colors` command displays your current color configuration.
